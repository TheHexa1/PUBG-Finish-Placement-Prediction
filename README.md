# PUBG-Finish-Placement-Prediction

2 years ago Kaggle collected data from [PUBG developer api](https://developer.pubg.com/) and made available to public. They launched a competition named "PUBG finish placement prediction". 

We are given over 65,000 games' worth of anonymized player data, split into training and testing sets, and asked to predict final placement from final in-game stats and initial player ratings.

We asked to create a model which predicts players' finishing placement based on their final stats, on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place)
